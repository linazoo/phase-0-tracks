# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows a team to work in a large code base and make changes to the code in an organized way. its useful because it lets you clone your repository to share with others and they can work on the same file without messing anything up!
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
a branch is a copy of your repo where you can make changes and test features before commiting it into the master branch.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
a commit gathers all the changes you made/staged. a good commit message tells you what changes you made at the time of that commit.
* What is a merge conflict?
a conflict that happens when two people are working and changing a file and try to merge it back into the master but it doesnt know which changes you want to keep.
