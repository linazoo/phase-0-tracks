<h2>How will you learn more about Jquery in 2 HOURS?</h2>
<br>
<i>⋅⋅* What sorts of resources would help?
⋅⋅* finding a youtube tutorial on how to use and what the key concepts are on using Jquery.
⋅⋅* What is it really? do I need to include (require it) since its a library?
⋅⋅* Should I download anything and then learn how to write things to use it?
⋅⋅* Apparently it makes things easier - how?!
⋅⋅* Its also easy to lear- HOW!?
⋅⋅* It helps with javascript... how!?
<br>
⋅⋅* Could I use the DOM to test it?
⋅⋅* Should I read the actual Jquery Library or just about what the library can do?
⋅⋅* Some of the best things I could do with that library would be a good way to start looking into youtube videos and live coding of how to use JQuery.
⋅⋅* Taking breaks should be a given - walk my dog every 35 mins? just to think about what I just read and really 'grasp' things.
