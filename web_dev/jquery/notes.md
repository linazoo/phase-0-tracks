<h2>How will you learn more about Jquery in 2 HOURS?</h2>
<br>
<i>- What sorts of resources would help?
- finding a youtube tutorial on how to use and what the key concepts are on using Jquery.
- What is it really? do I need to include (require it) since its a library?
- Should I download anything and then learn how to write things to use it?
- Apparently it makes things easier - how?!
- Its also easy to lear- HOW!?
- It helps with javascript... how!?
<br>
- Could I use the DOM to test it?
- Should I read the actual Jquery Library or just about what the library can do?
- Some of the best things I could do with that library would be a good way to start looking into youtube videos and live coding of how to use JQuery.
- Taking breaks should be a given - walk my dog every 35 mins? just to think about what I just read and really 'grasp' things.

<h2> Study up - Strategies that seem to be the most effective</h2>
<i>- Event binding / event listening(toggle on and off)
- It is good practice to wait for the document to be fully loaded and ready before working with it. This also allows you to have your JavaScript code before the body of your document, in the head section.
- jQuery selectors allow you to select and manipulate HTML element(s).
- Functions In a Separate File
- Play around/learn/use event methods
- DOM manipulation
