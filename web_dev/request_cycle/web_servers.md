<h2>What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?</h2>
<i>"Linux is primarily develped as a group effort by volunteers on the Intert from all over the world. Across the Internet and beyond, anyone with enough know-how has the opportunity to aid in developing and debugging the kernel, porting new software, writing documentation, or helping new users" The system itself is designed with a very open-ended, feature-minded approach. </i>

<h2>In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?</h2>
<i> "One big computer running a lot of smaller computers inside of it"
a VPS is a cloud that privately holds your information.
It only costs a fraction of the entire server. You can freely choose what operating system you want. Linux or Windows. One massive server is partitioned up so that it can have several servers on it running independently of each other. Virtualization layers are then created to make sure each virtual environment appears as a standalone server with the ability to run its own OS applications

<h2>Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?</h2>
<i>the root user is equivalent to the admin user on windows - but you shouldnt log in as a root on Linux because every hacker knows there is a root account and if they attack the system its a known entry point which will make it likely to be a target. Your root account should have logins disbaled. It's a safety net to use sudo accounts instead soo you can make sure you dont do anything 'dumb' that might harm your operationg system.</i>
