	<h1> How to be a vegetarian </h1>
	<p> One of the question I get asked the most is <em>"how have you been a vegetarian for so long?!" </em> so I'm here to tell you all how to make it really easy for yourself to be a vegetarian! </p>

	<h2> First steps to be successful in your veggie journey</h2>
	<ul>
		<li> Determination </li>
		<li> Starting small</li>
		<li> Learn to substitute </li>
		<li> Try new recipes </li>
		<li> Think about protein </li>
		<li> Forget about Junk Food</li>
	</ul>
	<strong> Reminder! </strong> 
	<p> This transition is not easy - it should be hard for you to give up something you're used to eating. If you're a picky eater who only eats burgers and ham sandwiches it will take you longer to get used to your new diets so START SMALL. </p>
