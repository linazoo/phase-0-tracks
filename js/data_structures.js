//Horses are great, but times are a-changin', and we need to add an option for faster transportation that we can create with an assembly line. Write a constructor function for a car. Give it a few different properties of various data types, including at least one function. Demonstrate that your function works by creating a few cars with it.

  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
  this.color = color;

//how do you loop through the keys and values of an object?
//We Could only find one method which is a for loop.

//Are there advantages to using constructor functions to create objects? Disadvantages?
//the object constructor allows you to make new objects of the same type. It is faster and more efficient than making each object one at a time.
  //1. Advantage: Constructors have better memory performance.
  //2. Advantage: Less likely to make a mistake because they all follow the format of the constructor
  //3. Disadvantage: you always have to construct a child of a pre-defined object. If you want to add a new parameter to just one object you must add it to the constructor first which impacts all objects made from it.
  //Disadvantage: you might forget to type new
